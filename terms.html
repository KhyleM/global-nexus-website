        <p>
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the services provided by Global Nexus 
            Enterprises LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), including our Scrubby application and 
            related services (collectively, the "Services").
        </p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
        <p>
            Global Nexus Enterprises provides technology platforms that connect service providers with 
            consumers. Our Scrubby application facilitates bookings between pet owners and pet care 
            service providers. We are not a pet care provider ourselves but rather a platform that 
            enables these connections.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
